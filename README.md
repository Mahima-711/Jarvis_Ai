Jarvis AI is a voice-controlled virtual assistant built using Python. It is designed to automate everyday tasks through simple voice commands. Jarvis can open applications, search the web, send emails, provide weather updates, read system information, and more. The project leverages libraries such as SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser, and smtplib to enable real-time interaction. This project helped me explore natural language processing, voice I/O, and the integration of APIs into intelligent systems.
